# Project 1 — Gaussian Models & Function Fitting (ASTR 205)

This project introduced foundational numerical and machine-learning tools used throughout the course. You implemented Gaussian and multi-Gaussian models, generated synthetic data, and performed nonlinear least-squares fitting to understand how parameter estimation works in astrophysics.

## 🚀 Overview
The goal of this assignment was to build intuition around model fitting, numerical optimization, and noise effects in scientific data. You explored:
- How Gaussian models behave under different parameters  
- How to fit models to data using SciPy  
- Why optimization can fail or become degenerate  
- How noise influences parameter recoverability  

## 🧠 Objectives
- Practice using core scientific libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)  
- Build and visualize analytic models  
- Fit models to synthetic data with `curve_fit`  
- Explore χ² landscapes and parameter degeneracies  
- Strengthen numerical intuition for astrophysical data analysis  

## 🛠 Methods & Techniques
- Gaussian and multi-Gaussian model construction  
- Nonlinear curve fitting with SciPy  
- Parameter grid search / χ² visualization  
- Investigating failure modes in optimization  
- Scientific plotting and multi-panel figure generation  

## 📈 Key Results
- Reproduced Gaussian models for a variety of amplitudes, widths, and centers  
- Demonstrated how poor initial guesses impact fitting stability  
- Visualized χ² surfaces showing degeneracies and local minima  
- Observed noise-driven uncertainty in parameter estimation  

## 📚 Skills Learned
- Turning analytic equations into reproducible code  
- Diagnosing optimization issues in model fitting  
- Understanding degeneracy and uncertainty in astrophysical inference  
- Using Python’s scientific ecosystem effectively
