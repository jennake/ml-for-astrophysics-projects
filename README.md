# ml-for-astrophysics-projects

This repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of the Machine Learning in Astrophysics postgraduate course at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (ASTR 205).
Each project explores how modern machine learning methods can be applied to real astronomical data, including galaxy photometry, stellar light curves, and SDSS spectra.
The projects demonstrate techniques such as:
Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
Supervised learning (regression & classification)
Unsupervised clustering
Representation learning with autoencoders
Scientific feature engineering
Time-series and spectral analysis
